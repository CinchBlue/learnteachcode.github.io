Learn Teach Code is a community for anyone who wants to learn about computer science or programming

Whether you're a total beginner or a coding ninja/guru/Jedi Master, we're here to learn about computer science and programming in a fun, informal environment -- and also to provide moral support to fight the fears and frustrations that come with learning a new skill or transitioning to a new career.

Learn programming fundamentals through a variety of languages and platforms together in small groups or pair programming -- everything from short tutorials to day-long hackathons/learnathons!

* Workshops -- build something tangible and learn new skills in our structured group classes!
* Co-working and casual learning - work on your own projects independently while enjoying the company of like-minded people.
* Discussion groups for language-agnostic topics (book club, anyone?)
* Project show-and-tell -- get feedback, generate ideas, or just show off your mad skillz!
* And other random, fun activities like geeky movie nights and joint events with other meetups!
